## Bigfoot Tracker

### A Bigfoot tracking personal project with a Mapbox heat map utilizing geoJSON sighting data from arcGIS and simple CRUD operations for users to submit their own sightings,

I built this web application with a Django frontend and React.JS backend while studying with Code Platoon!

### Stretch Goals:

Add messaging component for users
Integrate data pulled from sightings JSON with user sightings
Add ability for users to locate their closest sightings on Map through search
Complete the styling!
